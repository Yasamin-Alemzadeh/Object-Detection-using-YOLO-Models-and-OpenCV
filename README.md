# Object-Detection-using-YOLO-Models-and-OpenCV
This project demonstrates the power of object detection using YOLO (You Only Look Once) models and OpenCV. YOLO is a popular deep learning architecture for object detection tasks, and OpenCV is a comprehensive computer vision library. By combining these two technologies, we can build robust and efficient object detection systems
