**Object Detection using YOLO Models and OpenCV**
=====================================================

**Introduction**
---------------

This project demonstrates the power of object detection using YOLO (You Only Look Once) models and OpenCV. YOLO is a popular deep learning architecture for object detection tasks, and OpenCV is a comprehensive computer vision library. By combining these two technologies, we can build robust and efficient object detection systems.

**Project Overview**
-------------------

In this project, we'll explore the following topics:

1. **Installing Ultralytics and OpenCV libraries**: We'll guide you through the installation process using pip.
2. **Object Detection using YOLO Models**: We'll learn how to use YOLO models for object detection in images, including loading the model, detecting objects, and interpreting the results.
3. **Displaying Results using OpenCV**: We'll visualize the detection results by drawing bounding boxes around detected objects on the image using OpenCV.

**Features**
------------

* Object detection using YOLO models
* Image processing using OpenCV
* Displaying detection results with bounding boxes and confidence scores
* Support for multiple YOLO models (yolov8n.pt, yolov8n-seg.pt, yolov8n-pose.pt)

**Getting Started**
-------------------

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Install the required libraries using pip: `pip install yolov5 opencv-python`
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Yasamin-Alemzadeh/Object-Detection-using-YOLO-Models-and-OpenCV.git`
3. Run the Python script: `python object_detection.ipynb`

**Results**
----------

The project includes several examples of object detection on different images. You can modify the script to test it on your own images.
